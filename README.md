# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

With over 5 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable backend systems and deploying end-to-end AI solutions. My expertise lies in solving complex problems, implementing cutting-edge deep learning models (including LLMs), and delivering secure, production-ready systems.

## Projects

- [image-to-text-transformer](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/image-to-text-transformer): An end-to-end image captioning model utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT) and transformer architectures for generating descriptive text from images.
  
- [text-translation-transformer](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/deep-learning/tree/main/text-translation): This is kind of an implementation of the original "Attention is all you need" paper, but translating english to portuguese.
  
- [anime-recommender](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/anime-recommender): A simple synopsis-based recommender built with FastAPI and a transformer encoder. Embeddings are projected with BigBird-ROBERTA (encoder), supporting k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN, L2 distance) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for recommendations over 24 thousand animes.

- [pytorch-ocr](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/pytorch-ocr): A PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) small framework designed for accurate text extraction from images using CNNs, LSTMs and attention mechanism (no transformer, just the original attention modules).

- [image-captioning](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/deep-learning/tree/main/image-captioning): A deep learning project focused on generating textual descriptions for images using older approaches (cnn + lstm).

- [pix2pix](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/deep-learning/tree/main/pix2pix): Implementation of the Pix2Pix model for image-to-image translation tasks, enabling applications like style transfer and image synthesis. Quite outdated, but GANs were really something back then.

- [yolov1](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/deep-learning/tree/main/yolov1): A PyTorch implementation of the YOLOv1 object detection model paper, capable of real-time object detection in images and videos.

- [pytorch-object-detection-fundamentals](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/pytorch-object-detection-fundamentals): A PyTorch implementation of a classifier combined with a single object detector model, demonstrating fundamental concepts in object detection for beginners.

- [server-client](https://github.com/GabrielDornelles/server-client): A basic server to N clients in C sockets I've made for fun while I was in a vacation to show students how simple their life was with Python.

- [aiyume](https://aiyume.airinn.com.br/): A platform for anime roleplay with LLMs that have long-term memory. I've made this project to improve my frontend skills (react and typescript) and to learn Stripe payment integration and Supabase (to have a reliable cloud sql db that wouldnt just break because its only living inside a container). Everything there was done by myself so its a pretty good baseline to check the technologies I use.

I've worked on a few other projects too but they may be too much outdated nowadays.
